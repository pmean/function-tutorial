In R, there is a solid wall between what goes on in your R program and what goes on inside the functions that you write for your program. The functions are largely unaware of what is going on in your program and the rest of your program is largely unaware of what is going on in functions. There are ways, however, where you can peek around the wall and pass information back and forth.

A function in R can see values that appear in your main program.

```{r information_that_your_function_can_see}
rm(list=ls()) # start with a blank slate.
vegas <- function() {
  if (lottery_winnings>0) {return("Congraluations!")}
     else return("Sorry!")
}
lottery_winnings <- 0
vegas()
lottery_winnings <- 1E6
vegas()
```

But any changes made inside a function disappear once the function ends. In other words, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. The only thing that the main program can see is what the function returns.

```{r informantion_that_your_main_program_cannot_see}
rm(list=ls())
vegas <- function() {
  # You hit the jackpot.
  lottery_winnings <- 1e8
  print(paste("You've won", lottery_winnings,"dollars."))
  return("Congratulations!")
}
lottery_winnings <- 0
vegas()
print(lottery_winnings)
```

To allow changes inside a function to persist outside the function, use the "<<-" assignment operator.

```{r information_that_your_main_program_can_see}
rm(list=ls())
vegas <- function() {
  # You hit the jackpot.
  lottery_winnings <<- 1e8
  print(paste("You've won", lottery_winnings,"dollars."))
  return("Congratulations!")
}
lottery_winnings <- 0
vegas()
print(lottery_winnings)
```

I like that a lot better, don't you?

Now there are problems in the opposite direction also. A function doesn't know exactly what is being passed to it other than what the value itself is.

```{r information_that_your_function cannot_see}
rm(list=ls())
vegas <- function(winnings) {
  print(paste("You have", winnings,"dollars in", "???"))
  return("Congratulations!")
}
lottery_winnings <- 1e6
vegas(lottery_winnings)
poker_winnings <- 1e7
vegas(poker_winnings)
```

```{r using_deparse_and_substitute}
rm(list=ls())
vegas <- function(winnings) {
  variable_name <- deparse(substitute(winnings))
  print(paste("You have", winnings,"dollars in", variable_name))
  return("Congratulations!")
}
lottery_winnings <- 1e6
vegas(lottery_winnings)
poker_winnings <- 1e7
vegas(poker_winnings)
```

These are artificial examples, but here is a real example where you need to use the <<- assign operator and the deparse and substitute functions.

Many of my programs accumulate a large number of intermediate data.frames. I would like to store and document these data frames so I could review things easily should things go wrong. The archive function automates this process.

```{r archive_function}
rm(list=ls())
archive <- function(df) {
  # get the name of the data frame
  df_name <- deparse(substitute(df))
  print(df_name)
  if (!exists("arc")) arc <<- NULL
  arc[[df_name]] <<- df
  return(names(arc))
}
abc <- data.frame(x=LETTERS[1:3], y=letters[1:3])
archive(abc)
def <- data.frame(x=LETTERS[4:6], y=letters[4:6])
archive(def)
print(arc)
```
